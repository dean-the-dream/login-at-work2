## About

In order to login or logout at work I have to perform several step, go through about 4 different webpages, and also get a verification code. This process is very cumbersome and time consuming. To shorten the process, I have created an algorithm that will complete each step for me and log me in or out, all I have to do is click one button.

## Bugs

* Browser doesn't open in the center of the screen
* grab_images method doesn't parse individual words
* Code needs more copious notes, explaining my thought process
* the get_clicks method needs it's own module
* code needs to be refactored
* handling errors (what happens if a file isn't available)
